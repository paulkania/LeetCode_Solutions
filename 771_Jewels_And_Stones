L15 -> user defined function
L16 -> creat a dictionary(see it's right hand to see the return)
  #any dummy variable seems to act to take each letter one at a time (when regarding strings)
L17 -> for each letter in S (dummy_2 is another dummy variable, 
      1.  does not need to be predefined      2.  functions in by going through each element one at a time
L18 if the the element of S(your stone) is in the key(LH) of the dictionary (which represents J)
    then L19 : the value associated with the key is +=1.
L20   back-indent shows once loop is finished, ie once each element in S is finito, 
    return the sum of the values in the dictionary (which represent J.)
EDIT: in re-writing it myself, there was only 1 gloss-over. the dic[x]+=1...only values can be added to dicts
    , not keys, so the dic[___] += ___ will only ever effect values..it's not something that was on my mind.
EDIT#2: my main takeaways from the puzzle was the usefulness of dictionaries, the ubiquity (and getting more 
        comfy with dummy variables, which dont need to be pre-defined.
def jewels(S,J): 
	dic = {dummy: 0 for dummy in J}  #returns {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0}
	for dummy_2 in S:
		if dummy_2 in dic.keys():
			dic[dummy_2] +=1
	return sum(dic.values())

>>> J='abcd'
>>> S='aaaAbBBBB'
>>> jewels(S,J)
